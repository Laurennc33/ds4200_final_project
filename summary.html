    <h1>University attended based on socioeconomic standing</h1>

    <h3>Summary</h3>

    <p>This analysis of economic diversity in higher education institutions within the United States has illustrated a clear connection between socioeconomic status and college access. Wealthier students are more likely to attend out-of-state institutions and more prestigious schools, with a noticeable spike in out-of-state attendance at the 75th percentile of income. Higher income students are shown to have a broader range of schools to choose from, due to their financial resources. In-state attendance rates are more stable across income brackets, which indicate that while students from higher income families can seek opportunities across the entire country, lower-income students face financial and geographical constraints, leading them to be much more likely to stay in-state. 
    </p>

    <p>In states where the median household income is the lowest, the quality of education is low as well, with primarily less prestigious “selective public” institutions being the only ones represented. In states where the population boasts a higher median household income, many more top-tier schools are present.  The correlation found between high SAT scores and attendance rates, with Ivy Leagues at the top end points to the fact that academic preparation plays a significant role in securing spots at prestigious institutions, a further benefit for students who can afford to seek test preparation and rigorous high school coursework. 
    </p>

    <p>Overall, these findings only emphasize the many barriers to success that low-income people face in the United States, and give us insight into the specific metrics in one field. This stresses the need for policy reform in our country, to increase affordability of prestigious higher ed institutions and ensure that all people, regardless of the income level they are born into, have equal access to success.
